# Auto-leveling Tips
[NickEngmann](https://github.com/NickEngmann) suggests that 
> ... it is best to adjust the auto-leveler sensor position with the nozzle very close to the bed.
> Then the Z Offset is small and can be easily set using M851, M500, M501 and M503. (Tip: Fix Bed Level Sensor in its lowest position, then move it down to activate and use old credit cards to measure the gap, sensor - bed, and nozzle-bed. Subtract nozzle gap and readjust sensor fixing.)
